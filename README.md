Challenge: Efficiently handling and displaying real-time energy consumption data.
Solution:
Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data updates.
Implement efficient data caching on the frontend.
If using AWS IOT core, use its built in messaging system.
Data Visualization:
Challenge: Presenting complex energy consumption data in a clear and understandable way.
Solution:
Choose appropriate chart types (line graphs for trends, bar charts for comparisons).
Implement interactive charts with tooltips and zooming.
Provide customizable data filtering and aggregation options.
Authentication and Authorization:
Challenge: Securely managing user accounts and access control.
Solution:
Implement OAuth 2.0 using JWTs for authentication.
